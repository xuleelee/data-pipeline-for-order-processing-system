# Deploy the XGBoost on Segamaker 
Once DS team have trained, optimized and deployed the machine learning (ML) model, the next challenge is to host it in such a way that consumers can easily invoke and get predictions from it. 

`Amazon SageMaker` lets us host our model and provides an endpoint that consumers can invoke by a secure and simple API call using an HTTPS request. 

High level solutions in this part:
* Build end-points on `Segamaker` for hosting and deployment
* Invoking the `endpoint` from the web
    * Building `Lambda` Function 
    * Building `API Gateaway` (Rest API)
    * Invoke API Gateway with Lambda
* Test App

## Step 1 Creating the endpoint for a model on Segamaker 
Deploying the model to `SageMaker` hosting just requires a deploy call on the fitted model. This call takes an `instance count`, `instance type`. These are used when the resulting predictor is creatd on the endpoint.

 Pay attention to the instance type `ml.m4.xlarge` in below script where the model is being deployed, Amazon SageMaker doesnâ€™t support automatic scaling for burstable instances such as t2. We would normally use the t2 instance types as part of development and light testing.
```py
# Import api
import boto3
runtime = boto3.Session().client('sagemaker-runtime')

# Deploy the pre-trained model 'xgb_attached' as an endpoint
xgb_predictor = xgb_attached.deploy(initial_instance_count = 1, instance_type = 'ml.m4.xlarge')

# get the endpoint name and take note
xgb_predictor.endpoint

# invoke the endpoint 'xgb_predictor.endpoint' AND interact with endpoint
response = runtime.invoke_endpoint(EndpointName = xgb_predictor.endpoint, 
                                                  ContentType = 'text/csv',
                                                  Body = '1,6.67578125,3418,209,0.595703125,514,10.0,11,57,11,1599,0.1498791297340854,1.2884770346494763,0.22388993120700437,9.017543859649123,0.017543859649122806,46,0.02127659574468085') # test script: featureing fields in the model

# response: the probablility of a user buy the product
response['Body'].read().decode('utf-8')
```

## Step 2 Building Lambda Function 
Once created the `endpoint`, we need a way to invoke it outside a notebook. The endpoint in this project expects .csv input.

Here, use `AWS Lambda` and `Amazon API Gateway` to format the input request and invoke the endpoint from the web. 

* IAM Role: full access to Sagemaker
* Function Name: imba-function
```py
import boto3

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    body = event['body']
    runtime = boto3.Session().client('sagemaker-runtime')

    # use the SageMaker runtime to invoke our endpoint, sending the review we were given
    response = runtime.invoke_endpoint(EndpointName = 'xgboost-2022-03-27-05-04-39-419',
                                       ContentType = 'text/csv',
                                       Body = body
                                       )

    # The response is an HTTP response whose body contains the result of our inference
    result = response['Body'].read().decode('utf-8')

    # Round the result so that our web app only gets '1' or '0' as a response.
    result = float(result)

    return {
        'statusCode' : 200,
        'headers' : { 'Content-Type' : 'text/plain', 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' : '*' },
        'body' : str(result)
    }
```

## Step 3 Setting up API Gateway (Rest API)
**API Gateway Console**

After the stack has been created successfully, you can make a test call at API Gateway console
* Action: Create Method -- POST 
* Integration type: Lambda Function (imba_xgboost)
* Deploy API

```powershell
! Don't copy invoke URL at this step
```

**Lambda Console**
* Add Triggers and invoke with the API (Security: open)
* Copy API URL: https://********.execute-api.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/Test/imba_xgboost

## Step 4 Setting up API Gateway (Rest API)
Replace the ACTION URL in [index.html](/Project_part6_v3/index.html) with the API URL

## Step 5 Hosting a Static Websites on AWS S3 and Testing
Create a new S3 bucket: 
* Name: `imba-web-page-test`
* Untick `Block all public access`
* upload [index.html](/Project_part6_v3/index.html) file to S3 bucket 
* upload [error.html](/Project_part6_v3/error.html) to S3 bucket
* Enabling `static website hosting` under Properties tab
* Editing `Bucket Policy` under Permission tab for public access. Replace default script with [policy.json](/Project_part6_v3/policy.json)
